\label{sec:weno-burgers-fvs}

%\todo{Also note that I haven't followed the notation of the rest of the notes as I was too lazy to work out what it was.}

For a nonlinear scalar conservation law
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:scalar_conslaw}
  u_t + f(u)_x = 0
\end{equation}
the WENO method introduced in section~\ref{sec:ho-intro} above does not work,
as we have assumed the characteristic
information travels in one direction only. We have also reconstructed the
variable $q$ and from that constructed the ``flux'' which we feed into the
differencing formula of equation~\eqref{sec:ho-fd} to update the solution: this
will not work either.

In the nonlinear case, we instead reconstruct the \emph{flux} directly. That
is, given the state $u_i$ at location $x_i$, we compute the flux $f_i = f(u_i)$
and reconstruct the flux $f_{i+\myhalf}$ using the WENO reconstruction above.

This has the significant problem that we have no characteristic information for
the flux: does it propagate to the left or to the right? To get around this we
introduce \emph{flux splitting}. We write
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:flux-splitting}
  f(u) = f^{(+)}(u) + f^{(-)}(u)
\end{equation}
where we choose the functions such that the information contained in $f^{(+)}$
propagates to the right and that in $f^{(-)}$ propagates to the left. There are
many ways of doing this, but the simplest is the \emph{Lax-Friedrichs} flux
splitting
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:lf-flux-split}
  f^{(\pm)}(u) = \tfrac{1}{2} \left( f(u) \pm \alpha u \right)
\end{equation}
where $\alpha \ge \max | \partial_u f |$. With $\alpha$ being larger than the maximum propagation speed, this means that
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:lf-flux-split-speeds}
  \partial_u f^{(+)} \ge 0, \quad \partial_u f^{(-)} \le 0,
\end{equation}
and the characteristic information contained in $f^{(\pm)}$ will propagate as required.

The simplest flux-split algorithm is then
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Compute the maximum characteristic speed $\alpha$ over the entire computational grid;
  \item Compute the split fluxes $f^{(\pm)}$ from equation~\eqref{eq:lf-flux-split};
  \item Reconstruct $f^{(+)}$ to the right using, e.g., the WENO algorithm of section~\ref{sec:WENO};
  \item Reconstruct $f^{(-)}$ to the left using the same method;
  \item Compute $f_{i+\myhalf} = f^{(+)}_{i+\myhalf} + f^{(-)}_{i+\myhalf}$;
  \item Update the state using equation~\eqref{eq:consup}.
\end{enumerate}

{\label{fig:weno-vs-plm-burger} Numerical solutions to Burgers' equation using the piecewise linear method as in figure~\ref{fig:burgers-shock} and two flux-split WENO methods as outlined in section~\ref{sec:weno-burgers-fvs}. This uses the same sinusoidal data as figure~\ref{fig:burgers-shock} shortly after shock formation. Note that the WENO methods are not obviously any better at resolving the shock than the simpler piecewise linear approach.\\

As a direct comparison between the piecewise linear method used at the start of
this chapter, and the more complex WENO methods introduced here, we start with
looking at a shock forming from smooth initial data. Figure~\ref{fig:weno-vs-plm-burger}
shows the evolution of the sinusoidal initial data as used in figure~\ref{fig:burgers-shock},
but only showing the result at one time, shortly after characteristic crossing
leads to a shock. We see that there is very little difference between the
different numerical methods. The characteristic focusing means that all the
methods have a similar number of points within the shock. The piecewise linear
method appears to capture the edges of the shock slightly more accurate than the
(higher order) WENO method with $r=3$. This is likely as the piecewise linear
method is using the exact solution to the Riemann Problem, whilst the WENO method
is using the more diffusive Lax-Friedrichs flux splitting. At the higher $r=5$
order there is a marginal advantage to the WENO method.

{\label{fig:weno-converge-burgers} WENO solutions from evolving Burgers'
equation for an initial Gaussian profile, stopping before the solution is
discontinuous. A fourth order Runge-Kutta method is used for time evolution.
For $r=3$ we see the expected fifth ($2 r - 1$) order convergence.
For $r=5$ we see seventh order convergence briefly, before the error from the
time integrator dominates. \\

The advantages of the WENO method arise when the profile is still continuous, as
in the rarefaction problem, or at times before shocks have formed. To confirm
that high-order convergence is still possible for a nonlinear problem, an
initially Gaussian profile is evolved for a short time and compared to the
exact solution (computed from characteristic tracing). The resulting error
convergence is shown in figure~\ref{fig:weno-converge-burgers}. We see the
expected fifth and seventh order convergence rates, at least for some of the
resolutions. At too low a resolution the higher order terms in the error
expansion affect the solution. At too high a resolution, for the higher-order
method, the time integration error starts to dominate.
