\section{Elliptic equations}

The simplest elliptic PDE is {\em Laplace's equation}:
\begin{equation}
\nabla^2 \phi = 0
\end{equation}
Only slightly more complex is {\em Poisson's equation} (Laplace + a source term):
\begin{equation}
\nabla^2 \phi = f
\end{equation}
These equations can arise in electrostatics (for the electric potential),
solving for the gravitational potential from a mass distribution, or
enforcing a divergence constraint on a vector field (we'll see this
when we consider incompressible flow).

Another common elliptic equation is the {\em Helmholtz equation}:
\begin{equation}
(\alpha - \nabla \cdot \beta \nabla) \phi = f
\end{equation}
A Helmholtz equation can arise, for example, from a time-dependent
equation (like diffusion) by discretizing in time.

Notice that there is no time-dependence in any of these equations.
The quantity $\phi$ is specified instantaneously in the domain subject to
boundary conditions.  This makes the solution methods very different then
what we saw for hyperbolic problems.


\section{\label{elliptic:sec:fft} Fourier Method}

A direct way of solving a constant-coefficient elliptic equation is
using Fourier transforms.  Using a general Fourier transform (which we
consider here) works only for periodic boundary conditions, but other
basis functions (e.g., all sines or all cosines) can be used for other
boundary conditions. \MarginPar{ref?}

Consider the Poisson equation:
\begin{equation}
\nabla^2 \phi = f
\end{equation}
We will difference this in a second-order accurate fashion---see
Figure~\ref{fig:mg:laplacian}.  
\begin{figure}[t]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{laplacian}
\caption[Data centerings for the discrete Laplacian]{\label{fig:mg:laplacian} The centerings of the first and second
derivatives for a standard Laplacian discretization.  Our data, $\phi$,
is cell-centered.  The first-derivatives, $d\phi/dx$, are edge-centered, and the
second-derivative, $d^2\phi/dx^2$, is cell-centered.}
\end{figure}
%
In 1-d, the Laplacian is just the second-derivative.  If our solution
is defined at cell-centers, then we first compute the first-derivative
on cell edges:
\begin{align}
\left . \frac{d\phi}{dx} \right |_{i-\myhalf} &= \frac{\phi_i - \phi_{i-1}}{\dx}\\
\left . \frac{d\phi}{dx} \right |_{i+\myhalf} &= \frac{\phi_{i+1} - \phi_i}{\dx}
\end{align}
These are second-order accurate on the interface.  We can then compute
the second-derivative at the cell-center by differencing these edge values:
\begin{equation}
\left . \frac{d^2\phi}{dx^2} \right |_i = \frac{ d\phi/dx |_{i+\myhalf} - d\phi/dx |_{i-\myhalf}}{\dx}
\end{equation}

The extension to 2-d is straightforward.  Thinking of the Laplacian as $\nabla^2
\phi$ = $\nabla \cdot \nabla \phi$, we first compute the gradient of
$\phi$ on edges:
\begin{align}
[\nabla \phi \cdot \hat{x}]_{i+\myhalf,j} &= \frac{\phi_{i+1,j} - \phi_{i,j}}{\dx} \\
[\nabla \phi \cdot \hat{y}]_{i,j+\myhalf} &= \frac{\phi_{i,j+1} - \phi_{i,j}}{\dy} 
\end{align}
Again, since this is defined on edges, this represents a centered
difference, and is therefore second-order accurate.  We then
difference the edge-centered gradients to the center to get the
Laplacian at cell-centers:
\begin{align}
[\nabla^2 \phi]_{i,j} &=
   \frac{[\nabla \phi \cdot \hat{x}]_{i+\myhalf,j} -
         [\nabla \phi \cdot \hat{x}]_{i-\myhalf,j}}{\dx} +
   \frac{[\nabla \phi \cdot \hat{y}]_{i,j+\myhalf} -
         [\nabla \phi \cdot \hat{y}]_{i,j-\myhalf}}{\dy} \nonumber\\
%
  &= \frac{\phi_{i+1,j} - 2\phi_{i,j} + \phi_{i-1,j}}{\dx^2} +
     \frac{\phi_{i,j+1} - 2\phi_{i,j} + \phi_{i,j-1}}{\dy^2} = f_{i,j}
\end{align}        
Again, since we used a centered-difference of the edge values, this
expression is second-order accurate.  This is the standard {\em
  5-point stencil} for the 2-d Laplacian\footnote{There are other
  possible second-order accurate stencils, including a 9-point stencil
  in 2-d, that are less commonly used.}.

We now assume that we have an FFT subroutine (see
\S~\ref{sec:intro:ffts}) that can take our discrete real-space data,
$\phi_{i,j}$ and return the discrete Fourier coefficients,
$\Phi_{k_x,k_y}$, and likewise for the source term:
\begin{equation}
\Phi_{k_x,k_y} = \mathcal{F}(\phi_{i,j}) \quad
F_{k_x,k_y} = \mathcal{F}(f_{i,j})
\end{equation}
The power of the Fourier method is that derivatives in real space are
multiplications in Fourier space, which makes the solution process in
Fourier space straightforward.

We now express $\phi_{i,j}$ and $f_{i,j}$ as sums over their Fourier
components.  Here we define $M$ as the number of grid points in the
$x$-direction and $N$ as the number of grid points in the
$y$-direction.  As before, we are using $i$ as the grid index, we
will use $\imag$ as the imaginary unit:
\begin{align}
\phi_{i,j} &= \frac{1}{MN} \sum_{k_x = 0}^{M-1} \sum_{k_y = 0}^{N-1}
  \Phi_{k_x,k_y} e^{2\pi\imag i k_x/M} e^{2\pi\imag j k_y/N} \\
f_{i,j} &= \frac{1}{MN} \sum_{k_x = 0}^{M-1} \sum_{k_y = 0}^{N-1}
  F_{k_x,k_y} e^{2\pi\imag i k_x/M} e^{2\pi\imag j k_y/N} 
\end{align}

Inserting these into the differenced equation, we have:
\begin{align}
\frac{1}{MN}\sum_{k_x=0}^{M-1}\sum_{k_y=0}^{N-1}
\biggl \{
&\frac{\Phi_{k_x,k_y}}{\dx^2} e^{2\pi\imag j k_y/N}
  \left [ e^{2\pi\imag (i+1) k_x/M} -2 e^{2\pi\imag i k_x/M} +
         e^{2\pi\imag (i-1) k_x/M} \right ] + \nonumber \\
&\frac{\Phi_{k_x,k_y}}{\dy^2} e^{2\pi\imag i k_x/M}
  \left [ e^{2\pi\imag (j+1) k_y/N} -2 e^{2\pi\imag j k_y/N} +
         e^{2\pi\imag (j-1) k_y/N} \right ] \biggr \} = \nonumber \\
\frac{1}{MN}\sum_{k_x=0}^{M-1}\sum_{k_y=0}^{N-1}
 & F_{k_x,k_y} e^{2\pi\imag i k_x/M} e^{2\pi\imag j k_y/N}
\end{align}

We can bring the righthand side into the sums on the left, and we can
then look at just a single $(k_x,k_y)$ term in the series:
\begin{align}
  e^{2\pi\imag i k_x/M} e^{2\pi\imag j k_y/N}
  \biggl \{
  &\frac{\Phi_{k_x,k_x}}{\dx^2}
  \left [e^{2\pi\imag k_x/M} + e^{-2\pi\imag k_x/M} - 2 \right ] + \nonumber \\
  &\frac{\Phi_{k_x,k_x}}{\dy^2}
  \left [e^{2\pi\imag k_y/N} + e^{-2\pi\imag k_y/N} - 2 \right ] 
  - F_{k_x,k_y}
  \biggr \} = 0
\end{align}
Simplifying, we have:
\begin{equation}
  \Phi_{k_x,k_y} = \frac{1}{2}\frac{F_{k_x,k_y}}
      {\left [\cos(2\pi k_x/M) - 1 \right ] \Delta x^{-2} +
        \left [\cos(2\pi k_y/N) - 1 \right ] \Delta y^{-2}}
      \label{eq:FFTsol}
\end{equation}
This is the algebraic solution to the Poisson equation in Fourier (frequency)
space.  Once we evaluate this, we can get the real-space solution
by doing the inverse transform:
\begin{equation}
\phi_{i,j} = \mathcal{F}^{-1}(\Phi_{k_x,k_y})
\end{equation}


We can test this technique with the source term:
\begin{align}
f =\, & 8\pi^2\cos(4\pi y) \left [\cos(4\pi x) - \sin(4\pi x) \right ] - \nonumber \\
    & 16\pi^2 \left [ \sin(4\pi x)\cos(2\pi y)^2 + \sin(2\pi x)^2 \cos(4\pi y) \right ]
    \label{eq:mg:fftsource}
\end{align}
which has the analytic solution\footnote{Note: throughout this
chapter, we devise test problems by picking a function
that meets the desired boundary conditions and then inserting
it into the analytic equation we are solving to find the righthand
side}:
\begin{equation}
\phi = \sin(2\pi x)^2 \cos(4\pi y) + \sin(4\pi x)\cos(2\pi y)^2
\end{equation}
Note that this solution has the required periodic behavior.
Figure~\ref{fig:mg:fftpoisson} shows the solution.

\begin{figure}[t]

  convergence.

\end{figure}


The main downside of this approach is that, because we solve for a
single component independently (Eq.~\ref{eq:FFTsol}), this only works
for linear problems with constant coefficients.  This makes it an
excellent choice for cosmological problems solving the gravitational
Poisson equation with periodic boundaries on all sides of the domain
(see, e.g., \cite{heitmann:2008}).  However, for a problem like:
\begin{equation}
  \nabla \cdot (\beta \nabla \phi) = f
\end{equation}
there would be ``cross-talk'' between the Fourier modes of $\beta$ and
$\phi$, and we would not be able to solve for a single mode of
$\Phi_{k_x,k_y}$ independently.  We discuss more general methods that
work for these forms next.


\section{Relaxation}

Relaxation is an iterative technique, and as we will see shortly, it
provides the basis for the multigrid technique.  

Consider Poisson's equation, again differenced as:
\begin{equation}
\frac{\phi_{i+1,j} - 2 \phi_{i,j} + \phi_{i-1,j}}{\dx^2} +
\frac{\phi_{i,j+1} - 2 \phi_{i,j} + \phi_{i,j-1}}{\dy^2} = f_{i,j}
\end{equation}
For each zone $(i,j)$, we couple in the zones $\pm 1$ in $x$ and $\pm
1$ in $y$.  For the moment, consider the case where $\dx = \dy$.  If
we solve this discretized equation for $\phi_{i,j}$, then we have:
\begin{equation}
\phi_{i,j} = \frac{1}{4} (\phi_{i+1,j} + \phi_{i-1,j} + 
                          \phi_{i,j+1} + \phi_{i,j-1} - \dx^2 f_{i,j} )
\end{equation}
A similar expression exists for every zone in our domain, coupling all
the zones together.  We can't separate the solution of $\phi_{i,j}$
for the neighboring zones, but instead can apply an iterative
technique called {\em relaxation} (also sometimes called {\em
  smoothing} because generally speaking the solution to elliptic
equations is a smooth function) to find the solution for $\phi$
everywhere.  

Imagine an initial guess to $\phi$: $\phi_{i,j}^{(0)}$.
We can improve that guess by using our difference equation to define a
new value of $\phi$, $\phi_{i,j}^{(1)}$:
\begin{equation}
\phi_{i,j}^{(1)} = \frac{1}{4} (\phi_{i+1,j}^{(0)} + \phi_{i-1,j}^{(0)} + 
                                \phi_{i,j+1}^{(0)} + \phi_{i,j-1}^{(0)} - 
                                 \dx^2 f_{i,j} )
\end{equation}
or generally, the $k+1$ iteration will see:
\begin{equation}
\phi_{i,j}^{(k+1)} = \frac{1}{4} (\phi_{i+1,j}^{(k)} + \phi_{i-1,j}^{(k)} + 
                                  \phi_{i,j+1}^{(k)} + \phi_{i,j-1}^{(k)} - 
                                   \dx^2 f_{i,j} )
\end{equation}
This will (slowly) converge to the true solution\footnote{Formally,
  convergence is only guaranteed if the matrix in our linear system is
  {\em diagonally dominant}.  The Laplacian used here is not quite
  diagonally domainant, but these methods still converge.}, since each
zone is coupled to each other zone (and to the boundary values that we
need to specify---more on that in a moment).  This form of relaxation
is called {\em Jacobi iteration}.  To implement this, you need two
copies of $\phi$---the old iteration value and the new iteration
value.

An alternate way to do the relaxation is to update $\phi_{i,j}$ in
place, as soon as the new value is known.  Thus the neighboring cells
will see a mix of the old and new solutions.  We can express this in-place
updating as:
\begin{equation}
\phi_{i,j} \leftarrow \frac{1}{4} (\phi_{i+1,j} + \phi_{i-1,j} + 
                                   \phi_{i,j+1} + \phi_{i,j-1} - 
                                   \dx^2 f_{i,j} )
\end{equation}
This only requires a single copy of $\phi$ to be stored.  This
technique is called {\em Gauss-Seidel iteration}.  A host of other
relaxation methods exist, including linear combinations of these two.
An excellent discussion of these approaches, and their
strengths and weaknesses is given in \cite{multigridtutorial}.

Next consider the Helmholz equation with constant coefficients:
\begin{equation}
(\alpha - \beta \nabla^2) \phi = f
\end{equation}
We can discretize this as:
\begin{equation}
\alpha \phi_{i,j} - \beta \left ( 
    \frac{\phi_{i+1,j} - 2 \phi_{i,j} + \phi_{i-1,j}}{\dx^2} +
    \frac{\phi_{i,j+1} - 2 \phi_{i,j} + \phi_{i,j-1}}{\dy^2} \right )
= f_{i,j}
\end{equation}
and the update of $\phi_{i,j}$ through relaxation is:
\begin{equation}
\phi_{i,j} \leftarrow
     \left . \left ( f_{i,j} + \frac{\beta}{\dx^2} \phi_{i+1,j}
                             + \frac{\beta}{\dx^2} \phi_{i-1,j}
                             + \frac{\beta}{\dy^2} \phi_{i,j+1}
                             + \frac{\beta}{\dy^2} \phi_{i,j-1} \right ) 
\middle / \left ( \alpha + \frac{2 \beta}{\dx^2} + \frac{2 \beta}{\dy^2} \right ) \right .
\end{equation}
Notice that if $\alpha = 0$, $\beta = -1$, and $\dx = \dy$, we 
recover the relaxation expression for Poisson's equation from above.


\subsection{Boundary conditions}

When using a cell-centered grid, no points fall exactly on the
boundary, so we need to use ghost cells to specify boundary
conditions.  A single ghost cell is sufficient for the 5-point stencil
used here.  The common types of boundary conditions are {\em
  Dirichlet} (specified value on the boundary), {\em Neumann}
(specified first derivative on the boundary), and periodic.  Some
restrictions apply (see discuss this later, in
\S~\ref{sec:multigrid:solvability}).

\centering
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{fv-fd_grid_bc}
\caption[Node-centered vs.\ cell-centered data at boundaries]{\label{mg:fig:bcs} 
  A node-centered (top) and cell-centered (bottom) finite difference
  grid showing the data and domain boundaries.  Notice that for the 
  cell-centered grid, there is no data point precisely at the boundary.}
\end{figure}

Consider Dirichlet boundary conditions, specifying values $\phi_l$ on
the left and $\phi_r$ on the right boundaries.\footnote{If the value,
  $\phi_l$ or $\phi_r$ is zero, we call this a {\em homogeneous
    boundary condition}.  Otherwise we call it an {\em inhomogeneous
    boundary condition}} We'll label the first zone inside the domain,
at the left boundary, $\mathrm{lo}$, and the last zone inside the
domain, at the right boundary, $\mathrm{hi}$---see
Figure~\ref{mg:fig:bcs}.  To second order, we can average the zone values on 
either side of the interface to get the boundary condition:
\begin{eqnarray}
\phi_l &=& \frac{1}{2} ( \phi_\mathrm{lo} + \phi_\mathrm{lo-1} ) \\
\phi_r &=& \frac{1}{2} ( \phi_\mathrm{hi} + \phi_\mathrm{hi+1} )
\end{eqnarray}
This then tells us that the values we need to assign to the ghost cells are:
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eq:bc_inhomo_dir}
\phi_\mathrm{lo-1} &=& 2 \phi_l - \phi_\mathrm{lo} \\
\phi_\mathrm{hi+1} &=& 2 \phi_r - \phi_\mathrm{hi}
\end{eqnarray}

If we instead consider Neumann boundary conditions, we specify values
of the derivative on the boundaries: $\phi_x |_l$ on the left and
$\phi_x |_r$ on the right.  We note that a single difference across
the boundary is second-order accurate on the boundary (it is a
centered-difference there), so to second-order:
\begin{eqnarray}
\phi_x |_l &=& \frac{\phi_\mathrm{lo} - \phi_\mathrm{lo-1}}{\dx} \\
\phi_x |_r &=& \frac{\phi_\mathrm{hi+1} - \phi_\mathrm{hi}}{\dx}
\end{eqnarray}
This then tells us that the ghost cells are filled as:
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eq:bc_inhomo_neum}
\phi_\mathrm{lo-1} &=& \phi_\mathrm{lo} - \dx \, \phi_x |_l \\
\phi_\mathrm{hi+1} &=& \phi_\mathrm{hi} + \dx \, \phi_x |_r
\end{eqnarray}


\subsection{Residual and true error}

The {\em residual error} is a measure of how well our discrete solution
satisfies the discretized equation.  For the Poisson equation, we
can the residual as:
\begin{equation}
r_{i,j} = f_{i,j} - (L \phi)_{i,j} 
\end{equation}
and the residual error as:
\begin{equation}
\epsilon^{(r)} = \| r \|
\end{equation}
where $L$ represents our discretized Laplacian.  Note that $r$ is the
error with respect to the discrete form of the equation.  The true
error is the measure of how well our discrete solution approximates
the true solution.  If $\phi^\mathrm{true}$ satisfies $\nabla^2
\phi^\mathrm{true} = f$, then the true error in each zone is
\begin{equation}
e_{i,j} = \phi^\mathrm{true}(x_i,y_j) - \phi_{i,j} 
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
\epsilon^\mathrm{true} = \| e_{i,j} \|
\end{equation}

We can make $\epsilon^{(r)}$ approach machine precision by performing
more and more relaxation iterations, but after some point, this will
no longer improve $\epsilon^\mathrm{true}$.  The only way to improve
$\epsilon^\mathrm{true}$ is to make $\dx$ and $\dy$ smaller.
In practice we do not know the true solution so we cannot compute
$\epsilon^\mathrm{true}$ and will instead have to rely on
$\epsilon^{(r)}$ to monitor our error.

Note that since our operator is linear,
\begin{equation}
L e = L\phi^\mathrm{true} - L\phi = f - L\phi = r
\end{equation}
so the error in our solution obeys a Poisson equation with the residual
as the source---we'll see this in the next section.

\subsection{Norms}

There are several different norms that are typically used in defining
errors on the grid.  The $L_\infty$ norm (or `inf'-norm) is just the
maximum error on the grid:
\begin{equation}
\|e\|_\infty = \max_{i,j} \{ |e_{i,j}| \}
\end{equation}
This will pick up on local errors.  

The $L_1$ norm and $L_2$ norms are more global. 
\begin{eqnarray}
\|e\|_1 &=& \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i,j} |e_{i,j} | \\
\|e\|_2 &=& \left ( \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i,j} |e_{i,j} |^2 \right )^{1/2}
\end{eqnarray}
Generally, the measure in $L_2$ falls between $L_\infty$ and $L_1$.
Regardless of the norm used, if the problem converges, it should
converge in all norms.  For reference, the AMReX
library\footnote{\url{https://github.com/amrex-codes}} uses $L_\infty$
in its multigrid solvers.



\subsection{Performance}

  and the L2 norm of the residual (dotted lines) for 3 different
  resolutions (16, 32, and 64 zones). \\

\end{figure}

Consider the simple Poisson problem\footnote{This is the test problem
  used throughout {\em A Multigrid Tutorial} \cite{multigridtutorial}.
  We use the same problem here to allow for easy comparison to the
  discussions in that text.} on $x \in [0,1]$:
\begin{equation}
\phi_{xx} = \sin(x), \qquad \phi(0) = \phi(1) = 0
\end{equation}
The analytic solution to this is simply 
\begin{equation}
\phi^a(x) = -\sin(x) + x \sin(1)
\end{equation}
We can perform smoothing and compute both the error against the
analytic solution (the `true' error), $e \equiv \| \phi^a(x_i) - \phi_i \|_2$ and the
residual error, $\| r_i \|_2$.  Figure~\ref{fig:smootherror} shows these
errors as a function of the number of smoothing iterations for 3
different resolutions.

Notice that the true error stalls at a relatively high value---this is
the truncation error of the method.  From one resolution to the next,
the true error changes as $\dx^2$, indicating that we are
converging as our method should.  No additional amount of smoothing
will change this---we are getting the best answer to the problem we
can with our choice of discretization.
In contrast, the residual error decreases to machine precision
levels---this is indicating that our solution is an exact solution to
the discrete equation (to roundoff-error).
In practice, we can only monitor the residual error, not the true
error, and we hope that small residual error implies a small true
error.

Figure~\ref{fig:smoothnorms} shows the error with respect to the true
solution and of the residual for pure smoothing in three different
norms.  The overall behavior is qualitative similar regardless of the
choice of norm.

\end{figure}

To demonstrate the influence of the boundary conditions,
Figure~\ref{fig:smooth-badbcs} shows the norm of the true error for
the same problem, but this time with a naive implementation of the
boundary conditions---simply initializing the ghost cell to the
boundary value, instead of averaging to the interface:
\begin{align}
\phi_\mathrm{lo-1} &= \phi_\mathrm{lo} \\
\phi_\mathrm{hi+1} &= \phi_\mathrm{hi} 
\end{align}
We see that with this mistake at the boundaries, the error of the
entire solution is affected, and we get only first-order convergence
with resolution (this can be seen by looking at the spacing of the
curves).  The previous solution, with the correct BCs is shown for
reference, and shows second-order convergence.  It is important to
note that because every zone is linked to every other zone (and the
boundary) in elliptic problems, an error at the boundary can pollute the
global solution.

\subsection{Frequency/wavelength-dependent error}

We can think of the error in the solution as a superposition of high
(short) and low (long) frequency (wavelength) modes.  Smoothing works
really well to eliminate the short wavelength noise quickly, but many
iterations are needed to remove the long wavelength noise (see
Figure~\ref{fig:smooth}).  A very important concept to understand here
is that when we talk about long wavelength error, we are expressing it
in terms of the number of zones across the feature, not as physical
length.  We can get an intuitive feel for this behavior by thinking
about how smoothing works.  Every zone is coupled to every other zone,
and we can think about each zone seeing one more zone away for each
iteration.  When the error is short wavelength, that means that there
are only a few zones across it, and after a few iterations, all of the
zones have seen the short wavelength error, and can eliminate it.  For
a very long wavelength error, many iterations will be needed until the
smoothing couples one zone to another that is a wavelength away.

This behavior suggests that if we could represent our problem on a
coarser grid, the error will now be of shorter wavelength, and
smoothing will be more efficient.  This is the core idea behind
multigrid, which we see next.

\begin{exercise}[Smoothing the 1-d Laplace equation]
{Implement 1-d smoothing for the Laplace equation on
  cc-grid.  Use an initial guess for the solution:
  \begin{equation}
    \label{eq:mg:phimodes}
  \phi_0(x) = \frac{1}{3} ( \sin(2\pi x) + \sin(2\pi \, 8 x) + \sin(2\pi \, 16 x) )
  \end{equation}
  on a 128 zone grid with Dirichlet boundary conditions.  This initial
  guess has both high-frequency and low-frequency noise.  Observe that
  the high-frequency stuff goes after only a few smoothing iterations,
  but many iterations are needed to remove the low-frequency noise.
  You should see something like Figure~\ref{fig:smooth}.
}
\end{exercise}

Figure~\ref{fig:mg:smooth} illustrates this behavior.  We are solving
the Laplace equation, $\phi^{\prime\prime} = 0$ in 1-d on $[0,1]$ with
homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions.  The solution is simply
$\phi = 0$.  We use Eq.~\ref{eq:mg:phimodes} as an initial guess---this is a superposition
of 3 different modes.  We see that the after just a few iterations, the 
shortest wavelength mode, $\sin(2\pi 16x)$ is no longer apparent in the error,
and just the two longer wavelength modes dominate.  By 100 iterations,
the error appears to be only due to the longest wavelength mode, $\sin(2\pi x)$.
Even after 1000 iterations, we still see this mode in the error.  This 
demonstrates that the longest wavelength modes in the error take the
longest to smooth away.

\section{Multigrid}

The text {\em A Multigrid Tutorial}~\cite{multigridtutorial} provides
an excellent introduction to the mechanics of multigrid.  The
discussion here differs mainly in that we are dealing with
cell-centered/finite-volume data.  We already saw that the treatment
of boundary conditions is more complicated because we do not have a
point directly on the boundary.  The other complication comes in
transferring the data from a fine grid to a coarser grid, and back.
Before we discuss the multigrid technique, we'll understand how
the operations between grids work.


\subsection{Prolongation and restriction on cell-centered grids}

Multigrid relies on transferring the problem up and down a hierarchy of
grids. 
The process of moving the data from the fine grid to the coarse grid
is called {\em restriction}.  The reverse process, moving data from
the coarse grid to the fine grid is called {\em prolongation}.  If the
data on our grid is a conserved quantity, we want restriction and prolongation to
conserve the amount of stuff when transitioning data between the fine and coarse grids.


\subsubsection{1-d}

Consider a 1-d finite-volume/cell-centered finite-difference grid
shown in Figure~\ref{fig:mg:1dgrid-prolong}---we see a fine grid and the
corresponding coarser grid.
%

\begin{figure}[t]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{fvrestrict}
\caption[The geometry for 1-d
  prolongation and restriction]{\label{fig:mg:1dgrid-prolong} A fine grid and
  corresponding underlying coarse grid.}
\end{figure}
%
If $\phi$ represents a density, then
conservation requires:
\begin{equation}
\phi^c_j = \frac{1}{\dx^c} (\dx^f \phi^f_i + \dx^f \phi^f_{i+1} )
\end{equation}
or, for a jump in 2 in resolution ($\dx^c = 2 \dx^f$), 
\begin{equation}
\phi^c_j = \frac{1}{2} (\phi^f_i + \phi^f_{i+1} )
\end{equation}
This latter form appears as a simple average to the interface of the
two fine cells / center of the corresponding coarse cell.

The simplest type of 
prolongation is simply {\em direct injection}:
\begin{align}
\phi^f_i &= \phi^c_j \\
\phi^f_{i+1} &= \phi^c_j 
\end{align}
A higher-order method is to do linear reconstruction of the coarse
data and then average under the profile, e.g., 
\begin{equation}
\phi(x) = \frac{\phi^c_{i+1} - \phi^c_{i-1}}{2\dx^c} (x - x_i^c) + \phi_i^c
\end{equation}

To second-order, we can find the values of $\phi^f_i$ and
$\phi^f_{i+1}$  by evaluating $\phi(x)$ at the $x$-coordinate corresponding to their
cell-centers,
\begin{align}
x^f_i &= x^c_j - \frac{\dx^c}{4} \\
x^f_{i+1} &= x^c_j + \frac{\dx^c}{4}
\end{align}
giving
\begin{align}
\phi^f_i     &= \phi^c_i - \frac{1}{8} (\phi^c_{i+1} - \phi^c_{i-1}) \\
\phi^f_{i+1} &= \phi^c_i + \frac{1}{8} (\phi^c_{i+1} - \phi^c_{i-1}) 
\end{align}
Notice that this is conservative, since $\dx^f (\phi^f_i + \phi^f_{i+1}) = \dx^c \phi^c_j$.

\subsubsection{2-d}

% this figure can be created by figures/multigrid/2dgrid-mg.py
\begin{figure}[t]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{2dgrid-prolong}
\caption[The geometry for 2-d
  prolongation and restriction]{\label{fig:2dgrid-prolong} Four fine cells and the
  underlying coarse grid.  For prolongation, the fine cells in red are
  initialized from a coarse parent.  The gray coarse cells are used in
  the reconstruction of the coarse data.  For restriction, the fine
  cells are averaged to the underlying coarse cell.}
\end{figure}


Restriction from the fine grid to the coarse grid is straightforward.
Since the fine cells are perfectly enclosed by a single coarse cell,
we simply average:
\begin{equation}
\phi_{i,j}^c = \frac{1}{4} ( \phi_{--}^f + \phi_{+-}^f +
                             \phi_{-+}^f + \phi_{++}^f )
\end{equation}

Prolongation requires us to reconstruct the coarse data and use
this reconstruction to determine what the fine cell values are.  For
instance, a linear reconstruction of the coarse data in $x$ and $y$ is:
\begin{equation}
\phi(x,y) = \frac{m_x}{\dx^c} (x - x_i^c) + 
            \frac{m_y}{\dy^c} (y - y_j^c) + \phi_{i,j}^c
\end{equation}
with slopes:
\begin{eqnarray}
m_x &=& \frac{1}{2}({\phi_{i+1,j}^c - \phi_{i-1,j}^c}) \\
m_y &=& \frac{1}{2}({\phi_{i,j+1}^c - \phi_{i,j-1}^c})
\end{eqnarray}
%
When averaged over the coarse cell, $\phi(x,y)$ recovers the average,
$\phi_{i,j}^c$ in that cell (this means that our interpolant is
conservative).  We can evaluate the value in the fine cells by
evaluating $\phi(x,y)$ at the center of the fine cells,
\begin{eqnarray}
x_\pm^f &=& x_i^c \pm \frac{\dx^c}{4} \\
y_\pm^f &=& y_j^c \pm \frac{\dy^c}{4} \\
\end{eqnarray}
This gives
\begin{equation}
\phi_{\pm\pm}^f = \phi_{i,j}^c \pm \frac{1}{4}m_x \pm \frac{1}{4}m_y
\end{equation}
(Note: you would get the same expression if you averaged $\phi(x,y)$ over
the fine cell.)

There are other options for prolongation and restriction, both of
higher and lower order accuracy.  However, the methods above seem to
work well.


\subsection{Multigrid cycles}

The basic idea of
multigrid\footnote{ In these discussions, we use {\em multigrid} to
  mean {\em geometric multigrid}, where the coarsening is done to the
  grid geometry directly.  The alternative is {\em algebraic
    multigrid}, where it is the structure of the matrix in the linear
  system itself that is coarsened.}  is to smooth a little on the
current grid solving $L\phi = f$, compute the residual, $r$, then {\em
  restrict} $r$ to a coarser grid and smooth on that grid solving $Le
= r$, restrict again, $\ldots$.  Once you reach a sufficiently coarse
grid, the problem solved exactly.  Then the data is moved up to the
finer grids, a process called {\em prolongation}.  The error on the
coarse grid, $e$, is prolonged to the finer grid.  This error is then
used to correct the solution on the finer grid, some smoothing is
done, and then the data is prolonged up again.

Note: on the coarse grids, you are not solving the original system,
but rather an error equation.  If the boundary conditions in the
original system are inhomogeneous, the boundary conditions for the
error equations are now homogeneous.  This must be understood by
any ghost cell filling routines.

There are many different forms of the multigrid process.  The simplest 
is called the {\em V-cycle}.  Here you start of the fine grid, restrict
down to the coarsest, solve, and then prolong back up to the finest. 
The flow looks like a `V'.  You continue with additional V-cycles
until the residual error is smaller than your tolerance.



\subsection{Bottom solver}

% this figure can be created with figures/multigrid/mgtower.py
\begin{figure}[t]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{mgtower}
\caption[A multigrid hierarchy]{\label{fig:mgtower} Illustration of
  the hierarchy of grids leading to the coarsest 2-zone grid (in
  one-dimension).  Each grid has a single ghost cell to accommodate
  boundary conditions.}
\end{figure}

Once the grid is sufficiently coarse, the linear system is small
enough to be solved directly.  This is the bottom solver operation.
In the most ideal case, where the finest grid is some power of 2, $N_x
= N_y = 2^n$, then the multigrid procedure can continue down until a
$2\times 2$ grid is created (Figure~\ref{fig:mgtower} illustrates this idea
for a one-dimensional grid).  This is the coarsest grid upon which one
can still impose boundary conditions.  With this small grid, just
doing additional smoothing is sufficient enough to `solve' the
problem.  No fancy bottom solver is needed.

For a general rectangular grid or one that is not a power of 2, the
coarsest grid will likely be larger.  For the general case, a linear
system solver like conjugate gradient (or a variant) is used on the
coarsest grid.

\subsection{Boundary conditions throughout the hierarchy}

The general inhomogeneous boundary conditions from
Eqs.~\ref{eq:bc_inhomo_dir} and \ref{eq:bc_inhomo_neum} apply to the
finest level.  But because we are solving the residual equation of the
coarsest levels in the multigrid hierarchy, the boundary conditions on
$Le = r$ are all homogeneous (but of the same type, Dirichlet,
Neumann, or periodic, as the fine level).

Implementing these boundary conditions in your multigrid solver means
that you will have separate actions for the fine level (where
inhomogeneous boundaries may apply) and the coarser levels (where you
will always be homogeneous).

An alternate way to enforce boundary conditions is via {\em boundary
  charges}.  For inhomogeneous boundary conditions, boundary charges
can be used to convert the BCs to homogeneous BCs.  This has the
advantage of allowing the ghost cell filling routines only deal with
the homogeneous case.

Consider the one-dimensional Poisson equation, near the left boundary
our discretized equation appears as:
\begin{equation}
\frac{\phi_\mathrm{lo-1} - 2\phi_\mathrm{lo} + \phi_\mathrm{lo+1}}{\dx^2}
 = f_\mathrm{lo}
\end{equation}
Inhomogeneous BCs at the left boundary would give the condition:
\begin{equation}
\phi_\mathrm{lo-1} = 2 \phi_l - \phi_\mathrm{lo}
\end{equation}
Substituting this into the discrete equation, we have:
\begin{equation}
\frac{2 \phi_l - \phi_\mathrm{lo} - 2\phi_\mathrm{lo} + \phi_\mathrm{lo+1}}{\dx^2}
 = f_\mathrm{lo}
\end{equation}
Bringing the boundary condition value over to the RHS, we see
\begin{equation}
\frac{- 3\phi_\mathrm{lo} + \phi_\mathrm{lo+1}}{\dx^2}
 = f_\mathrm{lo} - \frac{2\phi_l}{\dx^2}
\end{equation}
Now the left side looks precisely like the differenced Poisson equation
with homogeneous Dirichlet BCs.  The RHS has an additional `charge' that
captures the boundary value.  By modifying the source term, $f$, in the
multigrid solver to include this charge, we can use the homogeneous 
ghost cell filling routines throughout the multigrid algorithm.
This technique is discussed a bit in~\cite{colellanotes}.

Note that the form of the boundary charge will depend on the form of the
elliptic equation---the expressions derived above apply only for
$\nabla^2 \phi = f$.




\subsection{Stopping criteria}

Repeated V-cycles are done until:
\begin{equation}
\| r \| < \epsilon \|f\|
\end{equation}
on the finest grid, for some user-input tolerance, $\epsilon$.  Here,
$\|f\|$ is called the {\em source norm}.  If $\|f\| = 0$, then we stop
when
\begin{equation}
\| r \| < \epsilon 
\end{equation}
Picking the tolerance $\epsilon$ is sometimes problem-dependent, and
generally speaking, a problem with a large number of zones will require
a looser tolerance.

The general rule-of-thumb is that each V-cycle should reduce your
residual by about 1 order of magnitude.  It is important that your
bottom solver solves the coarse problem to a tolerance of $10^{-3}$ or
$10^{-4}$ in order for the solver to converge.  Figure~\ref{fig:mgerror}
shows the true and residual errors for $\phi_{xx} = \sin(x)$ as a function
of V-cycle number, illustrating the expected performance.

\includegraphics[width=0.85\linewidth]{mg_error_vs_cycle}
\caption[Error in solution as a function of multigrid V-cycle
  number]{\label{fig:mgerror} Error in the multigrid solution to our
  model problem ($\phi_{xx} = \sin(x)$) as a function of V-cycle.  We
  see that the true error, $\|e\|$ stalls at truncation error while
  the residual error, $\|r\|$ reaches roundoff error, the same
  behavior as seen with smoothing alone (as expected). \\

\end{figure}

The overall convergence of the multigrid algorithm is limited by the
discretization of the Laplacian operator used and the implementation
of the boundary conditions.  Figure~\ref{fig:mg:convergence} shows
the error in the solution as the number of zones is increased---demonstrating
second-order convergence for our implementation.

\end{figure}


\section{Solvability}
\label{sec:multigrid:solvability}

For $\nabla^2 \phi = f$ with periodic or
Neumann boundaries all around, the sum of $f$ must equal $0$
otherwise the solution will not converge.  Instead, we will simply
find the solution increase each V-cycle.  This is seen as follows:
\begin{equation}
  \int_\Omega f d\Omega = \int_\Omega \nabla^2 \phi d\Omega =
  \int_{\partial \Omega} \nabla \phi \cdot n dS = 0
\end{equation}

For all homogeneous Neumann boundaries, we have $\nabla \phi \cdot dS
= 0$ by construction, so that integral is zero, requiring that the
source integrate to zero.  If the Neumann boundaries are inhomogeneous,
there is still a solvability condition on $f$ based on the sum on
the boundary values.

A simple example of solvability is:
\begin{equation}
\phi^{\prime\prime} = 0
\end{equation}
on $[a, b]$ with 
\begin{align}
\phi^\prime(a) &= A \\
\phi^\prime(b) &= B
\end{align}
We can integrate $\phi^{\prime\prime} = 0$ to get $\phi(x) = \alpha x
+ \beta$ where $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are integration constants.  But
note that this is just a straight line, with a single slope, $\alpha$,
so it is not possible to specify two unique slopes, $A$ and $B$ at the
boundary unless there is a non-zero source term.

For all periodic boundaries, we have $\nabla \phi
|_\mathrm{left} = -\nabla \phi |_\mathrm{right}$ on the left and right
boundaries by definition of the periodicity (and similarly for the top
and bottom).  Again this implies that $f$ must integrate to zero.

Sometimes, with periodic boundary conditions all around, you need to
enforce that $f$ integrate to zero numerically to test convergence.
This is discussed in \S~\ref{sec:lm:periodicbcs}.



\section{Going Further}

\label{sec:multigrid:other}

\subsection{Red-black Ordering}

When using domain decomposition to spread the problem across parallel
processors, the smoothing is often done as {\em red-black
  Gauss-Seidel}.  In this ordering, you imagine the grid to be a
checkerboard (see Figure~\ref{fig:rb}).  In the first Gauss-Seidel
pass you update the red squares and in the second, the black squares.
The advantage is that when updating the red, you can be sure that none
of the zones you depend on (the neighboring black zones) will change.
This makes the decomposition parallel.  Note: this works for the
standard 5-point Laplacian.  If you are doing some other operator with
a different stencil, then this decomposition may no longer hold.

\end{figure}





\subsection{More General Elliptic Equations}

The most general {\em second-order} elliptic equation takes the form:
\begin{equation}
  \alpha \phi + \nabla \cdot (\beta \nabla \phi) +
  \gamma \cdot \nabla \phi + \nabla \cdot (\zeta \phi) = f
\end{equation}
Here, $\gamma$ and $\zeta$ are vectors.  Solving a general elliptic
equation of this form can be accomplished with multigrid using the
same basic ideas here.  The main change is that the smoothing
algorithm and the construction of the residual will need to discretize
the more general operator, and these coefficients will need to
be restricted to the coarser grids (some on edges).  This is explored in
\S~\ref{sec:lm:vcelliptic} for a variable-coefficient Poisson equation:
 \begin{equation}
 \nabla \cdot (\beta \nabla \phi) = f
 \end{equation}
\ifdefined\debugmode
and in \S~\ref{sec:rad:generalelliptic} for an equation with $\zeta = 0$.
