\section{Introduction}

\pyro\ is a simple two-dimensional code that implements the core
solvers described in these notes.  It is written primarily in python,
with some kernels in Fortran.  Clarity of the methods is emphasized
over performance.


\section{Getting \pyro}

\pyro\ can be downloaded from its github repository, \url{https://github.com/zingale/pyro2} as:
\begin{verbatim}
git clone https://github.com/zingale/pyro2
\end{verbatim}

\pyro\ uses the {\sf matplotlib} and {\sf numpy} libraries.
Several routines are written in Fortran and need to be compiled.  The
script {\tt mk.sh} will build the packages.  This requires that {\tt
f2py} is installed.  By default, \pyro\ will use python 3.  
The following sequence will setup \pyro:
\begin{itemize}
\item Set the {\tt PYRO\_HOME} environment variable to point to the
  main {\tt pyro2/} directory, e.g.,
  \begin{verbatim}
  export PYRO_HOME=/path/to/pyro2
  \end{verbatim}

\item Set the {\tt PYTHONPATH} environment variable to point to the
  main {\tt pyro2/} directory, e.g.,
  \begin{verbatim}
  export PYTHONPATH="$PYTHONPATH:$PYRO_HOME"
  \end{verbatim}

\item Build the Fortran source using the {\tt mk.sh} script.  In the
  {\tt pyro2/} directory, simply do
  \begin{verbatim}
  ./mk.sh
  \end{verbatim}
\end{itemize}



\section{\pyro\ solvers}

\pyro\ offers the following 2-d solvers:
\begin{itemize}
\item {\em advection}: an unsplit, second-order method for linear advection,
  following the ideas from Chapter~\ref{ch:advection}.

\item {\em advection\_rk}: an alternate advection algorithm using
  method-of-lines time integration, again following the ideas
  from Chapter~\ref{ch:advection}.

\item {\em compressible}: an unsplit, second-order compressible
  hydrodynamics solver using the piecewise linear reconstruction
  discussed in Chapter~\ref{ch:compressible}.

\item {\em compressible\_rk}: an alternate compressible algorithm
  using method-of-lines time integration, using the piecewise
  linear reconstruction discussed in Chapter~\ref{ch:compressible}.

\item {\em diffusion}: a second-order implicit diffusion solver, based
  on the ideas from Chapter~\ref{ch:diffusion}.

\item {\em incompressible}: a second-order incompressible hydrodynamics
  solver using a cell-centered approximate projection, as discussed
  in Chapter~\ref{ch:incompressible}.

\item {\em lm\_atm}: a low-Mach number hydrodynamics solver for
  atmospheric flows, as discussed in S~\ref{sec:lm:atm}
  
\item {\em multigrid}: a multigrid solver for constant-coefficient Helmholtz
  elliptic equations.  This follows the ideas from Chapter~\ref{ch:multigrid},
  and is used by the diffusion and incompressible solvers.

\end{itemize}

\section{\pyro 's structure}

The structure of the code and descriptions of the various runtime
parameters is found on the pyro webpage,
\url{http://zingale.github.io/pyro2/}, and described
in \cite{pyro}.  Here we provide a summary.

The grid structure is managed by the {\tt patch.Grid2d} class.  Data
is that lives on the grid is contained in a {\tt
  patch.CellCenterData2d} object.  Methods are available to provide
access to the data and fill the ghost cells.

Each \pyro\ solver is its own python module.  All but the multigrid
solver represent time-dependent problems.  Each of these provide a
{\tt Simulation} class that provides the routines necessary to
initialize the solver, determine the timestep, and evolve the solution
in time.  Each solver has one or more sets of initial conditions
defined in the solver's {\tt problems/} directory.

All time-dependent problems are run through the {\tt pyro.py} script.
The general form is:
\begin{verbatim}
./pyro.py solver problem inputs
\end{verbatim}
 where {\em solver} is one of \{{\tt advection}, {\tt advection\_rk},
 {\tt compressible}, {\tt compressible\_rk}, {\tt diffusion}, {\tt
   incompressible}, {\tt lm\_atm}\}, {\em problem} is one of the
 problems defined in the solver's {\tt problems/} directory, and {\em
   inputs} is the name of an input file that defines the values of
 runtime parameter.

The possible runtime parameters and their defaults are defined in the
{\tt \_defaults} files in the main directory and each solver and
problem directory.  Note that the inputs file need not be in the 
{\tt pyro2/} directory.  The solver's {\tt problems/} directory
will also be checked.

\section{Running \pyro}

A simple Gaussian advection simulation is provided by the advection
{\em smooth} problem.  This is run as:
\begin{verbatim}
./pyro.py advection smooth inputs.smooth
\end{verbatim}
As this is run, the solution will be visualized at each step,
showing the progression of the simulation.  


A list of the problems available for each solver is given in
Table~\ref{tab:problems}.  For the multigrid solver, there are scripts
available in the {\tt multigrid/} directory that illustrate its use.
